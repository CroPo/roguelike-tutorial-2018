#/r/roguelikedev Tutorial (2018)

This is my participation to the Roguelike Tutorial of [/r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) of summer 2018. 
I chose to follow along using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as programming language, and utilizing the [tcod-rs](https://github.com/tomassedovic/tcod-rs) library.

Every part of the tutorial is a separate workspace member. You can run each lesson with `cargo run -p part_[X]` (where X is the lesson number, obviously). I try to add a documentation for each lesson to describe what I have done, and why I did it in that specific way.

Feel free to comment any piece of code you see. I'm open for any kind of constructive criticism.
