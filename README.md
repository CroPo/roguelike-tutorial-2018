# /r/roguelikedev Tutorial (2018)

![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/EYJFgdI.png)

This is my participation to the Roguelike Tutorial of [/r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) of summer 2018. 
I chose to follow along using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as programming language, and utilizing the [tcod-rs](https://github.com/tomassedovic/tcod-rs) library.

Every part of the tutorial is a separate workspace member. You can run each part with `cargo run -p part_[X]` (where X is the part number, obviously). I try to add a documentation for each part to describe what I have done, and why I did it in that specific way.

- [Part 1: Drawing the `@` symbol and moving it around](part_1/)
- [Part 2: The generic Entity, the render functions, and the map](part_2/)
- [Part 3: Generating a dungeon](part_3/)
- [Part 4: Field of View](part_4/)
- [Part 5: Placing Enemies and kicking them (harmlessly)](part_5/)
- [Part 6: Doing (and taking) some damage](part_6/)
- [Part 7: Creating the interface](part_7/)
- [Part 8: Items and Inventory](part_8/)
- [Part 9: Ranged Scrolls and Targeting](part_9/)
- [Part 10: Saving and Loading](part_10/)

Feel free to comment any piece of code you see. I appreciate any kind of feedback here, especially if it helps to get a better understanding of Rust itself.
