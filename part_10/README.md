# Part 10: Saving and Loading

- [Reddit Post on /r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/91do0i/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/)
- [Direct Tutorial Link](http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/10)

So, we're starting with loading and saving the game here. This time, I can just loosely resemble what the Python
tutorial does due to the obvious difference of both languages. Since I already have done a part of what the tutorial
wanted me to do - namely move all the game logic to another class - I don't expect much problems at all.
